    <h1>DZ License Program – Professional Straight Truck Training</h1>
    <p>
      The <b>DZ License</b> allows you to operate <b>straight trucks, dump trucks, cement trucks, garbage trucks, and other Class D vehicles</b> across Ontario.  
      It’s the ideal step for drivers looking to enter construction, local delivery, and municipal fleet jobs — stable, in-demand, and home every night.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our DZ course follows the <b>Ontario MELT (Mandatory Entry-Level Training)</b> requirements for Class D and provides full practical and theoretical instruction,  
      preparing you for both the DriveTest road exam and a real-world commercial driving career.

    <h2>Training Breakdown</h2>
    <h3>1. Classroom Theory</h3>
    <p>
      Students study traffic regulations, logbooks, hours-of-service, air brake operation,  
      defensive driving, and trip documentation. Training includes videos, instructor-led sessions, and practice tests.
    </p>

    <h3>2. Yard Training</h3>
    <p>
      Hands-on training on a private lot: pre-trip inspections, air brake tests, reversing, offset parking,  
      and load checks. All students use commercial straight trucks equipped with air brakes.
    </p>

    <h3>3. On-Road Driving</h3>
    <p>
      Real-world road experience through city and highway routes.  
      Instructors emphasize safe lane positioning, shifting, hazard perception, and handling of loaded vehicles.
    </p>

    <h3>4. Road Test Preparation</h3>
    <p>
      Final stage focuses on DriveTest standards: pre-trip script, in-cab checks, and simulated test routes.  
      Students use our certified truck for the official MTO exam.
