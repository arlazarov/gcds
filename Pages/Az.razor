    <h1>AZ License Program – Professional Tractor-Trailer Training</h1>
    <p>
      The <b>AZ License</b> authorizes drivers to operate large tractor-trailers and combination vehicles anywhere in Canada and the United States.
      It is the highest commercial driving class in Ontario and a mandatory qualification for long-haul and logistics industry jobs.
    </p>
    <p>
      At <b>Great Canada Driving School</b>, our AZ program meets all <a href="https://www.ontario.ca/page/mandatory-entry-level-training-class-az-drivers" target="_blank">MTO MELT standards</a> (Mandatory Entry-Level Training).  
      We combine classroom theory, yard practice, and real on-road experience to prepare students for both the <b>DriveTest road exam</b> and a successful career in transportation.

    <h3>1. Classroom Instruction</h3>
    <p>

      defensive driving, hours-of-service compliance, logbook and ELD operation,  
      cargo securement, border crossing procedures, and professional trip planning.  
      Reference: <a href="https://www.otds.com/class-az" target="_blank">Ontario Truck Driving School (OTDS)</a>.
    </p>

    <h3>2. Yard Training</h3>
    <p>
      Conducted on our private training lot using full-sized tractor-trailers.  
      Students master pre-trip inspection, coupling and uncoupling, straight-line and offset backing,  
      alley docking, and safety procedures before entering public roads.
    </p>

    <h3>3. On-Road Driving</h3>
    <p>
      Real-world driving through city, highway, and border routes under instructor supervision.  
      Emphasis on lane control, gear shifting (manual & automatic), merging,  
      hazard perception, fuel efficiency, and emergency maneuvering.  
      Based on <a href="https://chet.ca/melt-az-tractor-trailer-course" target="_blank">CHET</a> best practices.
    </p>

    <h3>4. Road Test Preparation</h3>
    <p>
      Final sessions focus on DriveTest standards: pre-trip inspection script, in-cab checks,  
      on-road evaluation, and exam route simulation. Each student is provided a certified truck for the official test.
